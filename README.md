# Unity Client 1.1
## Thank yous
Thank you **TurtleBOOM** for making me not skid

Thank you **Signam Kid** for (trying) to help me

Thank you **Blockswerker** for keeping up Sweet Anarchy (Unity 1.1 probably wouldn't have existed without Sweet Anarchy)

Thank you to anyone else I haven't mentioned who helped
## Can I use this code?
As long as you credit me (check LICENSE) do whatever you want. Make a fork, use some code in your own client, etc. I don't care, as long as credit is provided.
## Support
Support **won't** be provided as I don't work on this client anymore. However, if you need help with something related to development, you can contact me at eliteun17y#3788 on Discord (I might not respond, but I can try to help if it's related to development).
